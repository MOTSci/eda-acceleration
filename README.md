# Efficient Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with ydata-profiling

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to efficiently accelerate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the ydata-profiling package in Python. EDA is a crucial step in any data science process, providing insights into data quality, distributions, and relationships. With the ydata-profiling tool, we can automate much of the initial analysis, allowing for faster, more detailed profiling of large datasets.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- ydata-profiling

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
conda create --name your_env_name python=3.8

conda activate your_env_name
```

### Step 2: Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install ydata-profiling
```

### Step 3: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MOTSci/eda-acceleration.git
```

### Step 4: Get Familiar with ydata-profiling

Open the EDA_with_ydata-profiling.ipynb notebook to explore how to use ydata-profiling for EDA.

## Example Output

You can find example reports in the reports/ folder. These reports give a full breakdown of the dataset and provide actionable insights within minutes, drastically reducing the time spent on manual EDA.
